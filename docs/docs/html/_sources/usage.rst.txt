1. Run script OptimisationGUI/GUI/OptimisationGUI.py using TexGen's "Run Script" from the menubar.

2. Select the desired folder to house all the results files, this will be the scratch folder for the Abaqus models so make sure there is sufficient disk space.

3. In the GUI select the parameters for the optimisation.

4. In the next window, check the parameters are correct and run the optimisation.

5. Wait for the optimisation to finish.
