# IAA3DWeaveProject

This project provides a tool to aid optimisation of 3D woven composites using TexGen, the University of Nottingham's textile preprocessor coupled with the commercial finite element solver Abaqus. The purpose of the tool is to make it easier to carry out optimisations of 3D woven textile reinforcements using PyMoo's genetic algorithm library without needing to write extensive code in Python. 

The link to the documentation, where you can also find instructions on how to use the tool, is below.
